SETS 
blending multiple data sets together
compound queries comprises multiple, otherwise-independent queries.
      SELECT 1 num, 'abc' str
      UNION
      SELECT 9 num, 'xyz' str

SET operators
union vs union all 
union sorts the combined set and removes duplicates whereas union all does not
union all the number of rows in final data set will always equal sum of number of rows in the sets being combined

            SELECT 'ACTR' typ, a.first_name, a.last_name
            FROM sakila.actor as a
            UNION ALL
            SELECT 'ACTR' typ, a.first_name, a.last_name
            FROM sakila.actor as a
            ORDER BY last_name desc;
            
            SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
            FROM sakila.customer as c
            WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
            UNION ALL
            SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
            FROM sakila.actor as a
            WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
            
the UNION operator removes duplicates
			      SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
            FROM sakila.customer as c
            WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
            UNION
            SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
            FROM sakila.actor as a
            WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
            
the INTERSECT operator (empty set nothing overlaps)  also removes duplicates

				SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
				FROM sakila.customer as c
				WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'D%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'T%'
				INTERSECT
				SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
				FROM sakila.actor as a
				WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'D%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'T%';
				
(not empty set)

				SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
				FROM sakila.customer as c
				WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
				INTERSECT
				SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
				FROM sakila.actor as a
				WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%';
                
Sorting compound query results

				SELECT a.first_name as fname, a.last_name as lname
				FROM sakila.actor as a
				WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
				UNION ALL
				SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
				FROM sakila.customer as c
				WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
                ORDER BY lname, fname
